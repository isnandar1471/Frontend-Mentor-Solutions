## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library -->
<!-- - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework -->
<!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

- Variable cannot be used in media query. Only fixed value can be used in media query

❌ This will not work ❌

```css
@media (min-width: var(--layout-mobile)) {
  ...
}
```

<!-- ### Continued development
