This repository contains my solutions to various **Frontend Mentor Learning Path**.  
Each project is organized into its own folder, and every folder already has its own README with more details.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- Each folder = one Frontend Mentor project.
- Inside each project folder, you'll find a README describing:
  - The challenge details
  - Project preview
