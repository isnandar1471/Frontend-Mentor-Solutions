## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  <!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library -->
  <!-- - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework -->
  <!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

- Absolute with `left: 0; right: 0;` and Fixed Width

  If an element is `absolute` with both `left: 0` and `right: 0` **and has a fixed width**,  
  the browser prioritizes **`left: 0`** and ignores **`right: 0`**.

  To make both work, the width must be `auto` (it will then stretch between left and right).

### Continued development

- I still donâ€™t understand why using `.elementAbsolute { z-index: 1; }` with  
  `.elementAbsolute::after { z-index: 0; }` results in the pseudo-element staying **above** its parent, even though its z-index is lower.
