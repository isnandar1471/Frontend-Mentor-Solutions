## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  <!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library -->
  <!-- - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework -->
  <!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

penggunaan absolute, left 0, right 0 dengan width fixed, ternyata akan mengutamakan left 0, dan mengabaikan right 0

### Continued development

- aku masih belum bisa menggunakan .elementAbsolute z-index 1 dengan .elementAbsolute::after z-index 0. pseude after masih tetap di atas .elementAbsolute meskipun z-index kurang dari dia.
